# UDF-utils

Just a repository with utility `UDF`s (User-Defined Functions) for
ANSYS® Fluent® that I have developed. I'll add them to this repository
as I revisit them and use them.

The repository also contains simple configuration files for Visual
Studio Code so it will recognize Fluent macros and help coding.

Use this code at will. :)
